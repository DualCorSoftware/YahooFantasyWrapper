<h1>Yahoo! Fantasy Console</h1>
<p>
    This is a website that leverages the Yahoo! <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/YahooFantasyWrapper" target="_blank">Fantasy Sports Wrapper Nuget Package</a>. This package is a .NET Standard 2.0 Wrapper for the <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/index.html">Yahoo Fantasy Sports API</a>.
    At the moment, not all subresources are available, nor are any of the 'collection' elements. I do hope to add them, and they have been added to the code.
    If the token expires, the module will return a 'token_expired' error.
</p><p>
    The API is designed to act as a helper for those interacting with the Y! Fantasy API.
    The goal is for ease of use for the user, both in terms of querying endpoints and parsing responses. I've noticed that in working with the API, the data is not always
    the easiest to understand, so hopefully what I have created here will help people out.
